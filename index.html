						Players must purify gems one at a time. The entire purify process

					<p class="gs-how-to-play-description">
						Gem cards can only be activated during the Purify and Activate
						phase. To activate a card, you must discard the card from your
						pouch, then cast the spell named below the gem. Spells resolve the
						moment they are cast. If 2 players choose to activate gems at a
						similar time, the player quickest to their gem activation casts
						their spell first. Players must activate their gems one at a time.
						It is allowed to activate a gem while another gem is still being
						resolved, as long as the newly activated gem does not affect players
						resolving the effects of another gem.
					</p>
					<p class="gs-how-to-play-description">
						Some gem spells may break some rules. If that happens, such as
						Aquamarine’s Negate spell, follow the rules stated on the spell of
						the activated gem instead. To help gems complete their spells after
						being activated, an activated gem cannot be targetted by another gem
						and a gem targetted by another gem cannot be activated.

					Coen has been designing board and card games since before he can

					had a crazy idea for a fast-pace, chaos-riddled, card-slinging
					free-for-all. Everyone who played it agreed it should become a real
					live thing: no more flitty paper bits slip-sliding around the table
					tops! His friend Nathan kindly agreed to take on the challenge of
					creating the rock-steady theme for the game, as well as the digital
					art that would grace the new sturdier deck. And thus was the above
					colorful box of joy made real in this world, yeehaw!
